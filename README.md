# Links Directory (GitHub Pages)

This repository hosts a minimal GitHub Pages site that serves as a personal directory of commonly used websites.

- Edit `index.html` to add, remove, or update links and descriptions.
- The site uses Pico.css for a minimal, readable design via CDN.

To publish: enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (branch: `main`, folder: `/`).
